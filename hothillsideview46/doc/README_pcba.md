The goal is to make 5 boards of the same one-board PCB design.

Then:

- 2 boards get components on the top.
- 2 other boards get components on the bottom, not the same boards as got components on the top.
- 1 other board gets no components.


The PCB is reversible with identical component spots on the front and back sides.
The SMT footprints on the back and front sides
 are shadows of each other, 
with the same locations and the same orientations.

This zip has two position files:
- One to put components on the top of boards 1 and 2
- One to put components on the bottom of boards 3 and 4


And saying that in the pick and place file in the remarks.
